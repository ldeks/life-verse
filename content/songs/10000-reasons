<chorus 1/>
Bless the Lord
O My Soul
O My Soul
Worship his holy name

<chorus 1/>
Sing like never before
O My Soul
I'll worship Your holy name

<verse 1/>
The sun comes up
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing
Your song again

<verse 1/>
Whatever may pass
and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing
when the evening comes

<verse 2/>
You're rich in love
and You're slow to anger
Your name is great
and your heart is kind

<verse 2/>
For all your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for
my heart to find

<verse 3/>
And on that day
When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come

<verse 3/>
Still my soul will sing
Your praise unending
Ten thousand years
and then forevermore
