<verse 1/>
So you think
Think you can tell
Heaven from Hell?

<verse 1/>
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil?

<verse 1/>
Do you think you can tell?

<verse 2/>
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze?

<verse 2/>
Cold comfort for change
And did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

<chorus 1/>
How I wish
How I wish you were here

<chorus 1/>
We're just two lost souls
swimming in a fishbowl
Year after year

<chorus 1/>
Running over the same
old ground
How we found
the same old fears

<chorus 1/>
Wish you were here
