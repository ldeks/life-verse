<verse 1/>
Bring your tired
Bring your pain
Bring your guilt
And all your shame

<verse 1/>
Don't you know
that's not your name
You will always be
much more to me

<pre-chorus 1/>
Everyday I wrestle with
the voices that keep
telling me I'm not right

<pre-chorus 1/>
But that's alright

<chorus 1/>
'Cause I hear a voice
And He calls me Redeemed
When others say I'll
never be enough

<chorus 1/>
And greater is the One
living inside of me
than he who is
living in the world

<chorus 1/>
In the world
In the world

<chorus 1/>
And greater is the One
living inside of me
than he who is
living in the world
